# SCP fight club
 
## Overview
It's a calm day at the SCP containment fasility, too calm. Every scientist and security are wondering why it's so quiet, till a loud rawr breaks the silence. It's leading to a single place, the basement. The basement is where nearly every SCP that wanted to go, had their scheduled fightclub to finally figure out who's the strongest among them. 

### What's an SCP?

Here's the [SCP Foundation Wiki](http://www.scpwiki.com/) of which you can read all SCP stories. I will keep track of which SCP creatures I will be using.
