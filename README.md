# SCP fight club
 
##Overview
It's a calm day at the SCP containment fasility, too calm. Every scientist and security are wondering why it's so quiet, till a loud rawr breaks the silence. It's leading to a single place, the basement. The basement is where nearly every SCP that wanted to go, had their scheduled fightclub to finally figure out who's the strongest among them.
